# Computer Vision with CCTV

## Problem Statement

We are a Surveillance and CCTV company. We have a standard CCTV system, and we want to upgrade it into smart CCTVs. We want a solution that enables our cameras to detect human patterns, count objects, provide analysis within a 24-hour cooldown, and correctly detect the proper alert action for the system.

## Version Control

It is very important to track dependencies from the very beginning of the project. Here I am using `poetry` to manage my dependencies.

Following are the steps I have committed on my local machine before I start coding.

- Ensure poetry is installed. You can check that in the VS Code Terminal after specifying the directory by typing `poetry --version`
- Type `poetry init` to create the `pyproject.toml` file. This step is done once. Follow the guide generated by the command.
- To activate the virtual environment, type `poetry shell`. The first time, it will create a `.venv` folder in the directory, and since we are committing our local code to GitHub, it is recommended to add the `.venv` folder to `.gitignore`. The next step fulfills that, and we need to do it once.
    - `echo ".venv/" >> .gitignore` â€” this command will create `.gitignore` if not created earlier during the first time we initiated the repository in GitHub. It will add the `.venv` folder to `.gitignore`.

- Now, we are ready to add needed packages using poetry. Use `poetry add package`
- It is recommended that whenever we add a new package, we track and share the `requirements.txt` file. Use the below command always whenever you add a new package and before committing:
    - `poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt --without-hashes`
