# Computer Vision with CCTV

## Problem Statement

We are a Surveillance and CCTV company. We have a standard CCTV system, and we want to upgrade it into smart CCTVs. We want a solution that enables our cameras to detect human patterns, count objects, provide analysis within a 24-hour cooldown, and correctly detect the proper alert action for the system.


## [Proposed Solutions](https://github.com/laithrasheed/Computer-Vision-Projects/blob/main/Computer%20Vision%20with%20CCTV/Proposed%20Solution.ipynb)


## Version Control

It is very important to track dependencies from the very beginning of the project. Here I am using `poetry` to manage my dependencies. 

Following are the steps I have commited in my local machine before I start in coding. 

- Ensure poetry is installed. you can check that in the VS Cdoe Terminal after specifying the directory by typing `poetry --version`
- Type ``poetry init` to create the `pyproject.toml` file. This step is done once. Follow guide generated by the command.
- To activate the virtual invironment type `poetry shell`. In the first time it will create `.venv` file in the direcotry, and since we are commiting our local code to GitHub, it is recommended to add .venv file to `gitignore`. The next step fulfill that where we need to do it once.
    - `echo ".venv/" >> .gitignore` this command will create `gitignore` if not created earlier during the first time we intiated the repository in GitHub. It will add `.venv` file to gitignore.

- Now, we re ready to add needed packages using poetry. use `peotry add package`
- It it recommended that whenever we add a new package to track and share the `requirements.txt` file. Use the below command alwayns whenver you add a new package and before commiting:
    - `poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt --without-hashes`
